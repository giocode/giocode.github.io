  <h2 id="forecasting">Forecasting</h2>

<p>Forecasting is an important tool for making effective decisions, planning efficiently and reducing risks. </p>

<p>Forecasting is useful in many situations when uncertain quantity or event must and can be predicted. In other words, we must have data that allows to forecast the quantity or event accurately. Then, we need to build a model that can tell the difference between a random fluctuation and a existing pattern in the data. A good forecasting model should capture such patterns with a minimum out-of-sample error. </p>

<h3 id="time-series-forecasting">Time series forecasting</h3>

<p>Time series forecasting is concerned with only one question. Can we predict future values by looking at past ones? We are not attempting to identify factors that help explain the future. Instead, we want to accurately estimate how the historical data series will continue into the future. Thus, we want to find a functional relationship of the following form: </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
Y_{t+1} = f(Y_t, Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, ... , Y_{t-n}, \text{error})
</script>

<p>Such relationship is described by a time series model.</p>

<h3 id="basic-forecasting-steps">Basic forecasting steps</h3>

<p>There are in general four tasks that must be undertaken in forecasting.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Define the problem.</strong> This is the most difficult task as we need to determine what exactly to forecast, within what time horizon and how frequently. </li>
  <li><strong>Gather data.</strong> It is primordial to find and collect historical data to construct a model with which we can forecast the future. For time series, this can be anything that are observed sequentially over time. </li>
  <li><strong>Building and choosing models.</strong> This step involves choosing and fitting several forecasting models. Each model has parameters that must be fitted based on the known historical data. </li>
  <li><strong>Selecting and using the best model.</strong> We select the model that provides the most accurate predictions on the test data samples, i.e. data that were held out and not used for building the models. With the selected model, we can then predict future values and determine some prediction intervals.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="time-series-patterns">Time series patterns</h3>

<p>Before building any forecasting model, it often helps to explore time series data by simply plotting them. This help to understand the behavior of the series data and the patterns that exist in the data. There exist four types of time series data patterns: </p>

<ol>
  <li>A <strong>stationary <em>horizontal</em> pattern (H)</strong> exists when the data values clearly fluctuate around a constant mean. </li>
  <li>A <strong><em>seasonal</em> pattern (S)</strong> exists because of the effects of seasonal factors (e.g. beginning of fiscal year, financial reporting quarters, weekends, days of the week, holidays, etc.) Note that such patterns need not to be exactly periodic. </li>
  <li>A <strong><em>cyclical</em> pattern (C)</strong> is present when the data values show a sequence of rises and falls that are not of a fixed period. Typical examples of a cyclical pattern are business cycles that impact the quantity of sales over a longer period of time. </li>
  <li>A <strong><em>trend</em> (T)</strong> is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. For instance, stock prices of high-growth companies usually exhibit a strong upward trend over a long period of time. </li>
</ol>

<p>A time series can have many of these four components at the same time. Sometimes, it is more convenient to combine H, C and T as a cycle-trend pattern that represents long-term changes in the time series. As a result, we will think of time series as a function of three components: the trend, the seasonality and the random error:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\text{Time Series} = f(\text{Trend-Cycle}, \text{Seasonality}, \text{error})
</script>

<p>Most forecasting models explicitly assume that the random error is always present and try to minimize this error during model fitting. Depending on the actual time series, the functional relationship above can be additive or multiplicative. For example, we have the following with an additive decomposition model: </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 
\text{Time Series} = \text{Trend-Cycle} + \text{Seasonality} + \text{error}
</script>

<p>For a multiplicative model, the time series decomposes as follows: </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\text{Time Series} = \text{Trend-Cycle} \times \text{Seasonality} \times \text{error}
</script>

<p>In Haskell, we can for instance define a <code>TimeSeries</code> type as follows: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="haskell"><span class="line"><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">TimeSeries</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">TimeSeries</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">TimeStamp</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">Float</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="kr">type</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">TimeSeries</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Let’s suppose that we can appropriately define addition, substraction and multiplication over <code>TimeSeries</code>: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="haskell"><span class="line"><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">TS</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">TS</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">TS</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Additionally, we need convenience functions for creating lagged version of a time series or for extracting data points that are within a given window of the series:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="nf">window</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Time</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Time</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">TS</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="time-series-decomposition">Time series decomposition</h2>

<p>In principle, if we want to further analyze the time series, we can use decomposition methods that extract these individual patterns. Decomposition methods are useful for forecasting as the trend-cycle can be used to extrapolate future values. This is the idea of <strong>smoothing techniques</strong>, which <em>smooth</em> the series by eliminating the random fluctuations. Decomposition method is also needed when we want to detect anomalies such as outliers in the time series. We will cover about this topic later. </p>

<h3 id="basic-decomposition-method">Basic decomposition method:</h3>

<p>A simple decomposition method consists of the following steps: </p>

<ol>
  <li>The trend-cycle is computed using a Moving Average or LOESS method. </li>
  <li>The de-trended series is computed by removing the trend component from the time series. </li>
  <li>The seasonality component is extracted by averaging the values of the seasonal points over multiple periods (e.g. the values corresponding to same month for a monthly time series data)</li>
  <li>We obtain the residual errors by subtracting the previously estimated components from the time series.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Haskell, a decomposition method takes an input time series and return its three components:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="haskell"><span class="line"><span class="nf">decompose</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">TS</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">TS</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">TS</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">TS</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nf">decompose</span> <span class="n">timeseries</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">trendcycle</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">seasonality</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">residual</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Next, let’s see these specific techniques in more details. </p>

<h3 id="seasonal-effects-adjustment">Seasonal effects adjustment</h3>

<p>We have seen that a decomposition method fully decomposes the series. Sometimes, we may just need to adjust time series to seasonal effects. In that case, we only need to remove its seasonality component. For example, the seasonal variation may be irrelevant and even lead to false conclusions to our analysis objectives. For an additive model, the <em>seasonally adjusted series</em> is obtained after removing the seasonal pattern: </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\text{Seasonally Adjusted Series} = \text{Time Series} - \text{Seasonality} = \text{Trend-Cycle} + \text{error}
</script>

<p>For that, we can define function that decomposes a time series into its seasonality component and a seasonally adjusted series: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">      <span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">seas</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kr">_</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">decompose</span> <span class="n">ts</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h3 id="moving-averages">Moving averages</h3>

<p>The Trend-Cycle component can be estimated by <em>smoothing</em> the seasonally adjusted series. In other words, we reduce the random error fluctuations after removing the seasonality. The easiest way to do this is with a simple <em>moving average</em>. In the following, let’s consider several moving average methods. </p>

<h4 id="simple-moving-averages">Simple moving averages</h4>

<p>Moving average is based on the idea that values that are nearby in time are likely to be close. Hence, taking an average of neighboring points of each data point will yield a good estimate of the trend at that point. Local averaging smooths out the randomness in the data. There are two design parameters to consider: </p>

<ol>
  <li>How many data points do we include in each average? </li>
  <li>How much weight do we put for each neighboring point involved in the average? </li>
</ol>

<p>The simplest MA smoother averages an odd number of observations around each data point and put equal weights to them. For instance, a MA smoother of order 3 centered at a time <code>t</code> is: </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
T_t = \frac{1}{3} (Y_{t-1} + Y_{t} + Y_{t+1})
</script>

<p>Then, the estimate at time <script type="math/tex">t+1</script> is obtained by dropping the oldest observation <script type="math/tex">Y_{t-1}</script> and by including the next observation <script type="math/tex">Y_{t-2}</script>. Hence, the term <em>moving average</em> describes this procedure. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of points involved in the average, or the order of the MA, affects the smoothness of the estimate. More points lead to a smoother trend. The drawback of MA is that it is impossible to estimate the trend-cycle close to the beginning and end of the series. The higher the order, the more points we miss at the front and back of the series.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary, the movies averages takes two parameters: the number of points involved in each average and the weights of each point: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h3 id="double-moving-averages">Double moving averages:</h3>

<p>Moving averages can be combined by smoothing an already smoothed series. For example, a <script type="math/tex">3 \times 3</script> MA is a 3 MA of a 3 MA. When each 3 MA uses equal weights, the result is equivalent to a 5-period weighted moving average with the weigths 0.111, 0.222, 0.333, 0.222 and 0.111.</p>

<p>Thus, the following double moving average</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h3 id="weighted-moving-averages">Weighted moving averages:</h3>

<p>In general, a weighted MA with order <script type="math/tex">k</script> can be written as: </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
T_t = \sum_{j=-\frac{k-1}{2}}^{\frac{k-1}{2}} w_j Y_{t+j}
</script>

<h3 id="loess-smoothing">LOESS smoothing</h3>

<p>Alternatively, we can use a local linear regression technique to determine the trend of a time series. Precisely, we can fit a straight line through the observations near each data point. Then, the estimate of the trend at each point is given by each fitted line. For the data point at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>, the estimated trend-cycle <script type="math/tex">T</script> is given by: </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
T_t = a + bt 
</script>

<p>where the parameters $a$ and $b$ are determined for each point at time $t$ by minimizing the sum of squared error: </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sum{j=-\frac{k-1}{2}}^{\frac{k-1}{2}} w_j(Y_{t+j} - a - b(t+j))^2
</script>

<p>Another question is how much weight <script type="math/tex">w_j</script> we give to each point. Actually, Cleveland and his colleagues at Bell Labs propose a version of LOESS that is robust against outliers or unusual observations in the data. Their algorithm performs three things in each iteration: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Run a local weighted regression smoothing (<em>see above</em>) for given weights </li>
  <li>Compute the error residuals using the fitted curve </li>
  <li>Adjust the weights so that large errors receive smaller weights</li>
</ol>

<p>A loess function is thus defined as follows: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the LOESS is more computationally intensive than MA methods since a different value of $a$ and $b$ needs to be computed for every observation at a time $t$. For that, a different line is fitted at each data point using least squares. The number of points used in the local regression should not be too large to avoid underfitting and not too small to produce the desired smoothing. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="stl-decomposition">STL decomposition</h3>

<p>The STL decomposition method literally stands for “Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Loess”. It iteratively apply a LOESS smoother to give a decomposition that is robust against outliers. Another benefit of STL is that it has a flexibility to handle seasonality with abritrary length. The seasonality length just needs to be greater than one, which is usually satisfied in most applications. STL is flexible as it can handle trends of varying smoothness, missing values and seasonality of period other than quartlerly and monthly. </p>

<p>STL consists of the following two recursive procedures: </p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Inner loop.</strong> In each iteration of the inner loop, the seasonal and trend-cycle components are updated once. </li>
  <li><strong>Outer loop.</strong> An iteration of outer loop consists of one or two iterations of the inner loop. At the end of each outer loop iteration, outliers are detected. Future iterations of the inner loop puts smaller weights to these outliers in the LOESS regression.</li>
</ol>

<p>More details about the operations performed in these two loops are described below. Although STL works with arbitrary cycle length, let us simply assume that we have a monthly time series data. This will simplify the explanations.</p>

<h4 id="inner-loop-procedure">Inner Loop procedure:</h4>

<p>We start the procedure by assuming the trend-cycle component is zero. Then, each iteration of the inner loop does the following two things: </p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Seasonal smoothing</em>: updates the seasonality component </li>
  <li><em>Trend-cycle smoothing</em>: updates the trend-cycle smoothing </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seasonal smoothing</strong> </p>

<p>To obtain the seasonality component, we perform the following tasks in sequence: </p>

<ol>
  <li>De-trend the series by removing the current trend-cycle estimate</li>
  <li>Collect the de-trended values for each month. As a result, we will get 12 separate sub-series. </li>
  <li>Smooth each of these sub-series with a LOESS smoother. </li>
  <li>Glue back the sub-series together to obtain a preliminary seasonality component. </li>
  <li>Extrapolate the Loess smoother to estimate the seasonal component for a few months before and after the observed data.</li>
  <li>Run a <script type="math/tex">3 × 12 × 12</script> moving average on the resulting seasonality component. </li>
  <li>Follow with a LOESS smoothing of length 13 (one more than the seasonal period length). The loss of values at the beginning and end due to the moving average was anticipated and overcome by the extrapolation in <strong>Task 5</strong> above. This step also checks any possible trend component in the seasonality. </li>
  <li>Compute the seasonality component as difference between the results of step 6 and step 7. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Trend-cycle smoothing</strong></p>

<p>Given the seasonality component, get the trend-cycle with two simple steps: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Calculate the seasonally adjusted time series by substracting the seasonality from the original series. </li>
  <li>Smooth the adjusted time series with LOESS. </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="outer-loop">Outer Loop:</h4>

<p>The outer loop consists of the following steps: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Run one or two inner loop iterations to get the trend-cycle and seasonality.</li>
  <li>Calculate the error residuals by subtracting the trend-cycle and seasonality from the time series. </li>
  <li>Identify the observations with unusually large residual values. These could be outliers! </li>
  <li>Adjust the weights used for LOESS by downweighting the outliers. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that in the STL procedure, all future inner iterations of inner loop begin with the trend component from the previous iteration rather than starter from zero as in the very first iteration of the inner loop. </p>

<h3 id="stl-based-anomaly-detection-in-time-series">STL-based Anomaly detection in time series</h3>

<p>Proposed by Vallis and his colleagues at Twitter, STL decomposition can be used to detect outliers in long-term time series data with seasonality and trend-cycle. Their proposed method is piece-wise in the sense that a long-term time series is broken down into multiple windows of time series. </p>

<p>For each window, the following <strong>median-based outlier detection</strong> method is performed: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Extract the seasonality component <script type="math/tex">S</script> using STL decomposition. </li>
  <li>Compute the median <script type="math/tex">\tilde{Y}</script></li>
  <li>Compute the residual <script type="math/tex">R = Y - S - \tilde{Y}</script></li>
  <li>Run a standard outlier detection on the residuals (e.g. using median absolute deviation)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We have presented an overview of time series analysis and forecasting. Time series can be decomposed into three components: a trend-cycle, a seasonality and the error residual. To extract the trend-cycle, we can employe moving average and LOESS techniques. The seasonality component can be obtained from the de-trended series using the STL decomposition procedure, which is flexible and robust against outliers. The STL decomposition method is also a key ingredient for detecting anomalies and outliers in time series data. </p>
