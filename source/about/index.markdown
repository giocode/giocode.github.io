My name is Rindra. And I'm delighted to share my interests on software programming, data science and machine learning in this blog.

I am currently wrapping up my PhD program at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). My thesis project focused on designing new algorithms to improve the energy efficiency of the next-generation 5G wireless networks. My main tools are optimization, statistics and algorithm design. 

My passion is to build software that uses analytics to solve real-world problems or to answer important business questions. In particular, I believe the future of software will be at the intersection Big Data and [Internet of Everything (IoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) applications. Some of [**my projects**](http://giocode.github.io/projects/index.html) involved: 

- building novel anomaly detection techniques for real-time data,
- investigating new techniques to better train deep learning models,
- and using Apache Spark for scalable graph processing.

I am proficient in Java/Scala, Python and R and have basic working knowledge of Javascript. I like learning different programming paradigms such as functional, logic and declarative to be able to write better programs. 

Besides learning the latest technologies, I also love sharing my knowledge to like-minded people. 

Happy reading and drop me some comments! You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rindranirina) or email me at rindra "AT" ece "DOT" ubc "DOT" ca.
