My name is Rindra. And I'm delighted to share my interests in this blog. It is for the curious people who see beauty in functional programming, data science and machine learning as much as I do.

I am currently wrapping up my PhD thesis in Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia. Throughout my research, I continually worked with convex optimization, algorithm design and learning models and designed resource-efficient solutions for the next-generation 5G wireless networks.

Happy reading and drop me some comments! You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rindranirina).
